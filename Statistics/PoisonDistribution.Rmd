Poison distribution
dpois = punctual probability
ppois = cumulative
lower.tail False = bigger than right tail of the distribution

in a given day, the number of accidents is equal to 2,what's the probability of 3 in 1 day?
```{r}
dpois(3,lambda=2)
```
in a given day, the number of accidents is equal to 2,what's the probability of 3 or less in 1 day?
```{r}
ppois(3,lambda=2)
```
in a given day, the number of accidents is equal to 2,what's the probability of lass than 3
```{r}
ppois(2,lambda = 2)
dpois(0,lambda=2) + dpois(1,lambda=2) + dpois(2,lambda=2)
```
in a given day, the number of accidents is equal to 2,what's the probability of more than 3 in 1 day?
```{r}
ppois(3,lambda=2, lower.tail = F) 
1 - ppois(3,lambda=2) 
```
