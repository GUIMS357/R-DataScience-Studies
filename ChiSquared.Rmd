chi squared

creating a dataset to use 
```{r}
novel = matrix(c(19,6,43,32),nrow=2, byrow=T)
rownames(novel) = c("Male","Female")
colnames(novel) = c("Watch","DoesntWatch")
novel
```
chi squared
if p is bigger than 0,05, difference is insignificant
```{r}
chisq.test(novel)
```
change proportion of mans that watch novel

test again
```{r}
novel = matrix(c(22,3,43,32),nrow=2, byrow=T)
rownames(novel) = c("Male","Female")
colnames(novel) = c("Watch","DoesntWatch")
novel
chisq.test(novel)
```
